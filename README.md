# Cards!

A bunch of cards for my current D&D group, related to their player home: a nasty
tavern on the coast of the sea.

There are currently three major attributes the player home has:

* **Stability**: internal cohesion and satisfaction of all those involved:
  workers, neighbours and guests to the tavern. Lower stability leads to higher
  crime.
* **Security**: protection against outside sources, as well as actively engaging
  enemies that might threaten the land.
* **Attraction**: attraction of the bar to new customers. Also dubs as diplomacy
  skill for the tavern and/or the land.
* **Wealth Points**: current wealth points available to the player to invest
  into the business.
* **Wealth points per week**: How many wealth points the business as a whole
  makes per week (10 days).

Lots and lots of cards have to be added still.
